      <h3>Why Foster a Pet?</h3>
      <p>
        Fostering pets helps shelters save more lives by providing animals with a safe, loving environment while they wait for adoption. 
        As a foster, you give pets a second chance and help them adjust to home life, making them more adoptable. 
        Your support is vital for their well-being and happiness!
